# KatApp Framework

The KatApp framework is an orchestrator of two other well established frameworks; RBLe framework and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).  The primary function of the KatApp framework is to marshall inputs into a RBLe framework calculation, take the calculation results and turn them into a 'reactive' model that is then used for rendering HTML markup via Vue.  One caveat is that instead of standard Vue, KatApp framework is leveraging [petite-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue).  

> `petite-vue` is an alternative distribution of Vue optimized for progressive enhancement. It provides the same template syntax and reactivity mental model as standard Vue. However, it is specifically optimized for "sprinkling" a small amount of interactions on an existing HTML page rendered by a server framework.
